# RISK OF RELICS

A mod that adds relics and mechanics from Risk of Rain 2 into slay the spire. leave any new item suggestions in the comments. Looking for balancing suggestions too, I'm open. I plan to have every single item(excepting things like the artifact key) implimented, but that will take a while.
